    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I love to cook and I am a pretty confident baker, however, one thing Ive struggled with is finding a really incredible bread recipe. I know- kind of funny being as there are a zillion out there and bread is one of those basics” that almost anyone can make themselves.</p>
    <p> Nevertheless, I keep trying new recipes and have finally found one I really like and have gotten good results from! Even better- its easy and from start to finish it takes just over 2 hours!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups warm water</li>
        <li>1/2 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>1/4 cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>5-6 cups flour</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, dissolve the sugar in warm water and then stir in yeast. Allow to proof until yeast resembles a creamy foam, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Mix salt and oil into the yeast. Mix in flour one cup at a time.</li>
        <li>Knead dough for 7 minutes. Place in a well oiled bowl, and turn dough to coat. Cover with a damp cloth. Allow to rise until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Punch dough down. Knead for 1 minute and divide in half. Shape into loaves and place into two greased 9×5 inch loaf pans. Allow to rise for 30 minutes, or until dough has risen 1 inch above pans</li>
        <li>Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 30-40 minutes</li>
        <li>Cool, brush with butter and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
